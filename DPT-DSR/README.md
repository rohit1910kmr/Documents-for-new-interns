## 1. Email Requirements
- Everyone has to send two emails daily: one in the morning called DPT (Daily Planned Tasks) and one in the evening called DSR (Daily Status Report).
- The subject line for the aforementioned emails will be:
  - **DPT - PROJECT NAME/DATE/LOCATION** (If project is not assigned then please write 'Intern' in place of project name)
  - **DSR - PROJECT NAME/DATE/LOCATION** (If project is not assigned then please write 'Intern' in place of project name)
- The daily status reports should be cc'd to all stakeholders (i.e. daily_interns_reporting@fosteringlinux.com).
- Please send the DPT reports by 10:30 AM and the DSR reports by 11:59 PM. If these reports are not received on time, you might be marked absent for the day. Please note that this rule won’t apply to exceptional circumstances like night shifts, etc.

## 2. Report Format

### DPT (Daily Planned Tasks)
- **Salutation**: Begin with a salutation (e.g. Dear Sir/Ma'am).
- **Login Time**
  - If you have not been allotted a task by 10:30 AM, please clearly mention that you haven’t been assigned a task yet and the name of the person who was supposed to assign you the task (e.g., Waiting for task to be assigned by Mr. Harsh Choudhary).

#### Report Structure:
1. **Sl. No.**
2. **Task Description**
   - Instead of copying and pasting the task from the person you received it, write the task in your own words with your understanding of the task. This will help with your written English.
3. **Sub-tasks**
   - Divide your tasks into subtasks, and reflect them in the DPT and DSR. This will train you to create your WBS (attach your WBS in your reports).
4. **Task assigned by**
   - Person/Team name who has assigned the task to you.
5. **Technology**
6. **Start Date**
7. **Planned End Date**

11. **Remarks (if any)**
