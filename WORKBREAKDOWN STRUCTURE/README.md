## **What Is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?**<a id="what-is-a-work-breakdown-structure-wbs"></a>

**A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a visual, hierarchical and deliverable-oriented deconstruction of a project.** It is a helpful diagram for project managers because it allows them to break down their project scope and visualize all the tasks required to complete their projects.

All the steps of project work are outlined in the work breakdown structure chart, which makes it an essential project planning tool. The final project deliverable, as well as the tasks and work packages associated with it rest on top of the WBS diagram, and the WBS levels below subdivide the project scope to indicate the tasks, deliverables and work packages that are needed to complete the project from start to finish.

## **Why Use a WBS In Project Management?**<a id="why-use-a-wbs-in-project-management"></a>

Making a WBS is the first step in developing a project schedule. It defines all the work that needs to be completed (and in what order) to achieve the project goals and objectives. By visualizing your project in this manner, you can understand your project scope, and allocate resources for all your project tasks.

A well-constructed work breakdown structure helps with important project management process groups and knowledge areas such as:

- Project Planning, Project Scheduling and Project Budgeting

- Risk Management, Resource Management, Task Management and Team Management
